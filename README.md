Welcome to our Customer Segmentation Project! ðŸ‘‹ This project dives into the world of data-driven customer insights, where we used clustering techniques to identify distinct groups of customers based on their demographics, spending habits, and income.

Customer Segmentation Project This project uses Python and KMeans clustering to analyze and segment customers based on spending habits, income, and demographics. It includes API data fetching, preprocessing, and visualization, helping businesses understand customer personas for targeted marketing. Tools: Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to segment customers into meaningful groups, which can help businesses understand their audience better and tailor marketing strategies accordingly. By leveraging KMeans clustering in Python, we created distinct clusters that highlight different types of customer personasâ€”like high spenders, budget-conscious buyers, and more.

## Features
### API Data Fetching: 
Uses live data from an API to make the analysis dynamic and relevant to real-time insights.
### Data Preprocessing: 
Includes steps to clean, scale, and transform raw data for accurate clustering.
### Clustering Analysis:
Implements KMeans clustering to create distinct customer segments.
### Visualizations: 
Clear charts and graphs that help interpret and visualize the different clusters.
### Tools & Libraries
Python: The backbone of this project, used for data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning.
Jupyter Notebook: For an organized and interactive coding environment.
Pandas & NumPy: To handle data manipulation and preprocessing.
scikit-learn: For clustering algorithms and scaling.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating insightful visualizations.
